    <h3>Why a blog?</h3>
    <p>As a software developer, its important to be active and keep up with new technologies. <br />
        If you get too comfortable, and think that what you know now is enough, you're going to be in for a rude wakeup in a couple of year.
        Technology moves up rapidly, and by not keeping up, you'll eventually be irrelevant <br />
        That is the core reason behind keeping a tech blog. <br />
        In this blog I write articles about personal projects I work on, about new libraries and new frameworks I've tried etc.
