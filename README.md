# BlogApp-ASP.Net

A sample web app using APS.NET web-forms, for "Advanced web programming" course on UBT - Master.


The web app has:
1. Web form to show list of blogs, to view a specific blog, about and contact forms, and a web form to create a new blog.
2. Forms-based authentication to access the create blog form/
3. Several validators on forms, a search control, and ASP.Net XML Web Service.
4. Header and Master Page.
etc.

It's intentionally quite simple, only meant to showcase some framework/language features.
